| **-audit-log-mandatory**                          | Feature flag to enable strict mode for audit log configuration. When enabled this feature, a Shoot cluster will only be created when an auditlog tenant exists (this is defined in the auditlog mapping configuration file) (default true) |
| **-converter-config-filepath string**             | File path to the gardener shoot converter configuration. (default "/converter-config/converter_config.json")                                                                            |

| **-gardener-ratelimiter-burst int**               | Gardener client rate limiter burst for Runtime Controller.

| **-gardener-ratelimiter-qps int**                 | Gardener client rate limiter QPS (queries per seconds) for Runtime Controller. The queries per second has direct impact on the load produced for the Gardener cluster (see https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/how-to/customize-controller-manager-rate-limit) (default 5) |
| **-gardener-request-timeout duration**            | Timeout duration for Gardener client for Runtime Controller. Requests to the Gardener cluster are cancelled when this timeout is reached (default 3s)                                                                           |
| **-health-probe-bind-address string**             | The address the probe endpoint binds to. Kubernetes is using the probe endpoint to determine the health state of the application process (default ":8081")                                                                       |
| **-kubeconfig string**                            | Paths to a kubeconfig. Only required if out-of-cluster.                                                                                                                                  |
| **-kubeconfig-expiration-time duration**          | Expiration time is the maximum age of a Shoot kubeconfig until it is considered as invalid (default 24h0m0s)                                                                             |
| **-leader-elect**                                 | Enable leader election for controller manager. Enabling this will ensure there is only one active controller manager.                                                                     |
| **-metrics-bind-address string**                  | The address the metric endpoint binds to. Monitoring and alerting tools can use this endpoint to collect application specific metrics during runtime (default ":8080")                                                          |
| **-minimal-rotation-time kubeconfig-expiration-time** | The ratio determines what is the minimal time that needs to pass to rotate the kubeconfig of Shoot clusters. The ratio determines what is the minimal time that needs to pass to rotate the kubeconfig of Shoot clusters. For example if kubeconfig-expiration-time is set to `24hs` and `minimal-rotation-time` is set to `0.5`, then the next reconciliation after 12 hours will trigger the rotation (default 0.6) |
| **-runtime-ctrl-workers-cnt int**                 | Number of workers running in parallel for Runtime Controller. The number of parallel workers has an impact on the amount of requests send to the Gardener cluster (default 25)                                                |

| **-zap-devel**                                    | Development Mode defaults(encoder=consoleEncoder,logLevel=Debug,stackTraceLevel=Warn). Production Mode defaults(encoder=jsonEncoder,logLevel=Info,stackTraceLevel=Error)                  |
| **-zap-encoder value**                            | Zap log encoding (one of 'json' or 'console')                                                                                                                                           |
| **-zap-log-level value**                          | Zap Level to configure the verbosity of logging. Can be one of 'debug', 'info', 'error', or any integer value > 0 which corresponds to custom debug levels of increasing verbosity       |
| **-zap-stacktrace-level value**                   | Zap Level at and above which stacktraces are captured (one of 'info', 'error', 'panic').                                                                                                   |
