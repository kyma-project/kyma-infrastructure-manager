                                            If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                                            should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                                            the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                                            index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                                            referencing a part of an object.

                                        SystemReserved is the configuration for resources reserved for system processes not managed by kubernetes (e.g. journald).
                                        When updating these values, be aware that cgroup resizes may not succeed on active worker nodes. Look for the NodeAllocatableEnforced event to determine if the configuration was applied.

                                        Please merge existing resource reservations into the kubeReserved field.
