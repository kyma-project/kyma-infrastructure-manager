**Description**
<!-- Provide a clear and concise description of the feature. -->
This is a Proof of Concept. Here's a checklist that should help you consider often neglected aspects:-
- [ ] should the PoC include any documentation such as ADR?
- [ ] is it clear who will benefit from the PoC and how?
- [ ] will the final implementation require any migration steps?
- [ ] is there a need for alignment with KEB/SRE/other teams? 
- [ ] usually it's worth timeboxing such PoC tasks. What would be a good timebox in this case?
- [ ] will the final solution need a new repository or any pipelines adjustments?
- [ ] are we already aware of any additional challenges related to the release process? E.g. should additional threat modelling sessions be scheduled?
- [ ] will automated tests require any unusual efforts? E.g. complex setup for e2e tests?
