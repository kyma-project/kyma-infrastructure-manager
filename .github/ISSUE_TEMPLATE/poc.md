**Description**
<!-- Provide a clear and concise description of the feature. -->
This is a Proof of Concept. Here's a checklist that should help you consider often neglected aspects:-
- [ ] should the PoC include any documentation such as ADR?
- [ ] is it clear who will benefit from the PoC and how?
- [ ] is migration needed,
- [ ] is there a need for alignment with KEB/SRE/other teams? 
- [ ] usually it's worth to timebox such PoC tasks. What would a good timebox in this case?
- [ ] will the final solution need a new repository or any pipelines adjustments?
- [ ] are we already aware about any additional challenges related to release process?
